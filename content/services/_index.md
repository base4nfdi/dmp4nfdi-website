      # subtitle:
      text: |
        We provide RDMO hosting for NFDI consortia through a multi-tenant RDMO instance. This setup allows each consortium to have a customised RDMO client, while still enabling the exchange of DMP templates and modules across the NFDI.

        RDMO can connect seamlessly with many tools your consortium already uses, such as repositories, registries, or helpdesks. We provide integration support and help you link these systems with RDMO via API.
