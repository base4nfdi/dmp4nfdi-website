We support the integration of RDMO with other tools and services. RDMO provides a REST API and a plugin architecture that enables flexible integration with other web services. It allows for a dynamic exchange of information to and from RDMO. 

## What do we offer?

We support the integration of RDMO with other tools and services. These may include services provided by your consortium or other web services that are relevant to your community and available via API. 

Our Services include:

- Developing new open-source plugins to connect services to RDMO
- Supporting and extending existing plugins based on your requirements
- Setting up and configuring plugins for your RDMO client

### Example integrations

RDMO can connect directly to many tools your consortium already uses. Here are some examples on what’s possible: 

- **Use your own databases**: connect RDMO to community-specific resources (e.g. instrument, sensor, or vocabulary databases) to fill in metadata automatically
- **Add person information via ORCID**: Search ORCID from within RDMO and add researcher IDs and affiliations directly to the plan
- **Connect with OpenProject or GitLab**: Sync tasks between RDMO and your project management system
- **Publish directly to Zenodo/Invenio or other repositories**: When a project is ready to share data or software, RDMO can automatically create a Zenodo record with metadata and links from your DMP
- **Fetch information from GitHub**: Import project or software details (title, description, contributors) into RDMO automatically from existing GitHub repositories
- **Enhance workflows with custom features**: Generate usage statistics or enable AI-assisted help via chatbot plugin

If your consortium already provides services or APIs, such as repositories, registries, or helpdesks, we can help you connect them with RDMO.

# How to get started? 

## Apply for an incubator project

An incubator project is a short-term engagement (3–6 months) with a clearly defined goal. We hold regular calls to onboard new consortia. 

Before submitting a proposal for service integration, please [contact us](/contact/) to discuss feasibility.

Learn the details on [→ Incubator Projects](/incubator/).

### What your consortium needs to provide

In our [Service Cooperation Model](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15004953) we describe in detail what you need to provide in order to implement the service for your consortium. 

Service integrations may require additional personnel, depending on your specific needs. In some cases the connected services may need to be adapted in order to provide the required data or API functionality. We strongly recommend providing a community-specific DMP or SMP template, as well as planning outreach activities.
