We offer you support in using RDMO for the creation of DMP or SMP catalogs, tailoring them to the needs of your community, and aligning them with the developed [NFDI DMP Template Framework](#nfdi-dmp-template-framework).

## Support with DMP/SMP template development

Depending on the status of templates from your consortium and your previous experience with RDMO, we can offer help with transferring textual templates into RDMO or revising existing RDMO templates and adapting them to the structure of our developed [NFDI DMP Template](#nfdi-dmp-template-catalog-in-rdmo). You can also do the steps on your own and get advice from us.

### NFDI DMP Template Framework

The [NFDI DMP Template Framework](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16737078) serves as a uniform standard for DMP template development across the NFDI consortia. To maintain international alignment and promote interoperability, [RDMO attributes](https://rdmo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/management/catalog-development.html#attributes) were mapped to the [RDA DMP Common Standard for machine-actionable Data Management Plans](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard) (RDA maDMP). Subsequently, questions assigned to the attributes across various RDMO catalogs were examined (e.g. DFG Checklist, Horizon Europe, RDMO). The first version focuses on DMPs and will be constantly updated. We are currently working on the integration of SMPs and further ideas to improve the framework. 

For easier reuse of the framework, we developed the RDMO catalog [**NFDI DMP Template**](#nfdi-dmp-template-catalog-in-rdmo).

### NFDI DMP Template (Catalog in RDMO)

Based on the framework and its standardised attributes, the [NFDI DMP Template catalog in RDMO](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo-catalog/blob/main/shared/DMP4NFDI/NFDI_DMP_Template.md) provides a flexible starting point for creating domain-specific DMP templates, or refining existing ones. The catalog contains all attributes that are already mapped to the RDA maDMP. This ensures that the information collected is interoperable and can be seamlessly exchanged between systems as a starting point for creating maDMPs. You can import the catalog to your RDMO instance and adjust or extend it to suit your consortium’s needs, while the questions have the same content reference (i.e. Attributes).

# How to get started? 

## Apply for an incubator project

An incubator project is a short-term engagement (3–6 months) with a clearly defined goal. We hold regular calls to onboard new consortia. 

Learn the details on [→ Incubator Projects](/incubator/).

### What your consortium needs to provide

In our [Service Cooperation Model](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15004953) we describe in detail what you need to provide in order to implement the service for your consortium. 

Developing or adapting a template requires the assistance of personnel with the necessary scientific background and knowledge of your consortium. We strongly recommend running a community-specific RDMO client and integrating RDMO by connecting it to other services relevant to your consortium, as well as planning outreach activities.
