We offer you support in using RDMO for the creation of DMP or SMP catalogs, tailoring them to the needs of your community, and aligning them with the developed [NFDI DMP Template Framework](#nfdi-dmp-template-framework).

## Support with DMP/SMP template development

Depending on the status of templates from your consortium and your previous experience with RDMO, we can offer help with transferring textual templates into RDMO or revising existing RDMO templates and adapting them to the structure of our developed [NFDI DMP Template](https://github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo-catalog/blob/main/shared/DMP4NFDI/NFDI_DMP_Template.md). You can also do the steps on your own and get advice from us.

### NFDI DMP Template Framework

The [NFDI DMP Template Framework](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16737078) is intended to serve as a uniform standard for DMP template development for the NFDI consortia and to provide an initial basic DMP template. At the same time, it is openly available, and suitable for reuse. The catalog is in its first version and focuses on DMPs. We are working on the integration of SMPs and further ideas to improve this model during the integration phase.

# How to get started? 

## Apply for an incubator project

An incubator project is a short-term engagement (3–6 months) with a clearly defined goal. We hold regular calls to onboard new consortia. 

Learn the details on [→ Incubator Projects](/incubator/).

### What your consortium needs to provide

In our [Service Cooperation Model](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15004953) we describe in detail what you need to provide in order to implement the service for your consortium. 

Developing or adapting a template requires the assistance of personnel with the necessary scientific background and knowledge of your consortium. We strongly recommend running a community-specific RDMO client and integrating RDMO by connecting it to other services relevant to your consortium, as well as planning outreach activities.
