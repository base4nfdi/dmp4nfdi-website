We provide train-the-trainer activities and community outreach support to help your NFDI consortium strengthen data and software management practices and encourage the adoption of DMPs, SMPs, and RDMO across your community.

## Training and capacity building

Using our modular [Train-the-Trainer concept](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15771036), we help you explore the design of DMP and RDMO training for varying experience levels, ranging from basic introductions to strategic and long-term integration. 

Unlike standard workshops, our TtT sessions focus on practical didactic methods to ensure effective knowledge transfer. These workshops can be adapted to your community’s specific needs and seamlessly integrated into your existing training programs.

All training materials will be openly available and continuously updated to reflect the evolving needs of the NFDI consortia.

## Community Outreach Support

We help you raise awareness of Data and Software Management Planning within your consortium by showcasing the value of RDMO. Our outreach services include developing low-barrier introductory sessions, live demos, tailored presentations, and quick-start materials with you. We can help you prepare practical formats to engage diverse audiences for consortium meetings, conferences, or other events.

# How to get started? 

## Apply for an incubator project

An incubator project is a short-term engagement (3–6 months) with a clearly defined goal. We hold regular calls to onboard new consortia. 

Learn the details on [→ Incubator Projects](/incubator/).

### What your consortium needs to provide

In our [Service Cooperation Model](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15004953) we describe in detail what you need to provide in order to implement the service for your consortium. 

To ensure effective adoption, your consortium takes the lead in community outreach activities, such as webinars or training sessions, to promote and strengthen the use of DMPs and SMPs within your community. We strongly recommend providing a community-specific DMP or SMP template and integrating RDMO by connecting it to other tools and services relevant to your consortium.
