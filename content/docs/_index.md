# **DMP4NFDI - FAQs**


## **1. Data Management Plans (DMPs)**

**Q: What is a Data Management Plan (DMP)?**  
A DMP is a structured document outlining how research data will be managed during and after a project. It covers areas like data collection, storage, sharing, long-term archiving, and ethical considerations, ensuring compliance with funder and institutional requirements.

**Q: Why should I create a DMP?**  
A DMP helps you:  
- Organize and streamline your research data workflows.  
- Comply with funder requirements.  
- Enable data reuse within and beyond your research community.  

**Q: Who creates and uses DMPs?**  
DMPs are typically created by researchers or research data managers at the start of a project and updated as needed. They are used to plan data workflows and to document decisions for compliance and transparency.


## **2. DMPs in RDMO**

**Q: What is a DMP in RDMO?**  
In RDMO, a DMP template is called a "Catalog." It is a template that structures the DMP creation process into sections and questions, helping researchers answer relevant data management aspects step-by-step.

**Q: Can RDMO handle discipline-specific needs?**  
Yes! With the help of DMP4NFDI, consortia can develop discipline-specific DMP templates (Catalogs) tailored to their community's requirements.

**Q: Can we reuse an RDMO Catalog after it’s created?**  
Yes! Once the Catalog is complete, researchers in the consortium can use it as a DMP template to generate project-specific DMPs, answering questions on topics like data types, licenses, ethics, and long-term archiving.

**Q: How does DMP4NFDI support the development of these Catalogs?**  
We work with consortia through focused **Incubator-Projects**. 
where we collaborate e.g., to 
- Identify the consortium's data management needs.  
- Develop a discipline-specific Catalog (DMP template) in RDMO.  
- Train research data managers to implement and train their community in using the template. 


## **3. RDMO Hosting by DMP4NFDI**

**Q: What does DMP4NFDI’s hosting service offer?**  
We provide hosted **Mandanten** (RDMO instances) for consortia, including:  
- A dedicated RDMO website and login.  
- Discipline-specific DMP templates (Catalogs).  
- Optional integrations with other consortium services (e.g., databases or registries).


## **4. Training & Outreach**

**Q: How does DMP4NFDI support knowledge transfer?**  
We offer:  
- **Train-the-Trainer (TTT) Workshops**: Equip research data managers with the skills to support their communities.  
- Comprehensive guides and FAQs for using RDMO and the developed templates.

**Q: Who should attend TTT workshops?**  
Data stewards, research data managers, or anyone in your consortium responsible for supporting researchers with DMP creation.

**Q: How can we make RDMO known in our community?**  
As part of our incubator projects, we help consortia:  
- Promote the use of RDMO.  
- Train key stakeholders.  
- Develop tailored communication strategies for their discipline.


## **5. Getting Started with DMP4NFDI**

**Q: What are the benefits of using DMP4NFDI's service?**  
- **Customization**: Create templates tailored to your consortium's needs.  
- **Community Empowerment**: Train your research data managers to independently support and train others on all things concerning DMPs.  
- **Efficient Resource Use**: Focus on what matters most while we handle technical setup and hosting.

**Q: How can my consortium participate?**  
To access our service, your consortium needs to apply through one of our **Calls for Incubator Projects**. These calls are held approximately two times per year, and consortia are invited to submit proposals outlining their specific project. 
Incubator projects:   
- Run for ca. 6 months.  
- Have a clearly defined goal (e.g., setting up an RDMO instance, developing a discipline-specific DMP template, integrating RDMO with other services, or training on DMPs and RDMO).  
- Require active collaboration, including providing your specific requirements for the DMP.

**Q: How do we get started?**
