We offer you support by community outreach activities to raise awareness and promote adoption and use of DMPs, SMPs and RDMO within your NFDI consortium.

## Support with outreach activities

We help you raise awareness of Data and Software Management Planning within your consortium by showcasing the value of RDMO. Our outreach services include developing low-barrier introductory sessions, live demos, tailored presentations, and quick-start materials with you. We can help you prepare practical formats to engage diverse audiences for consortium meetings, conferences, or other events.

## How to get started? 

We hold regular calls to onboard new consortia. See our information on [Incubator Projects](/incubator/).

## What your consortium needs to provide

In our [Service Cooperation Model](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15004953) we describe in detail what you need to provide in order to implement the service for your consortium. 

To ensure effective adoption, your consortium takes the lead in community outreach for DMPs, SMPs and the use of RDMO. We strongly recommend providing a community-specific DMP or SMP template, and integrating RDMO by connecting it to other services in your service portfolio.
