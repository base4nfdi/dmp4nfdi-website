We offer Train-the-Trainer (TtT) workshops and tailored support to help you design and deliver effective training activities. Our goal is to support you in raising awareness and promoting the adoption of DMPs, SMPs, and RDMO within your NFDI consortium.

## TtT concept 

**Who is this for?** 

For NFDI members responsible for DMPs or interested in providing discipline-specific DMP knowledge to their communities. We refer to them as *DMP facilitators*.

**How can it help you?** 

Our [modular TtT concept](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15771036) includes clearly structured learning objectives, didactic approaches, and practical feedback methods to support effective and scalable training. 

## TtT workshops

**Who is this for?** 

For DMP facilitators looking for hands-on guidance to build internal capacity in data management planning and the use of RDMO.

**How can it help you?** 

Using our [modular TtT concept](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15771036), we help you explore the design of DMP and RDMO training for varying experience levels, from basic introductions to strategic and long-term integration. In comparison with regular workshops, our train-the-trainer workshops provide practical guidance on didactic methods for effective knowledge transfer. These sessions can be later adapted to your communityâ€™s needs and integrated into your existing training efforts.

## How to get started? 

We hold regular calls to onboard new consortia. See our information on [Incubator Projects](/incubator/).

## What your consortium needs to provide

In our [Service Cooperation Model](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15004953) we describe in detail what you need to provide in order to implement the service for your consortium. 

To ensure effective adoption, your consortium takes the lead in training activities for DMPs, SMPs and the use of RDMO. We strongly recommend providing a community-specific DMP or SMP template, and integrating RDMO by connecting it to other services in your service portfolio.
