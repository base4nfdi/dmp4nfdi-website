The documentation is currently in progress and a first version will be available at the end of the first project phase.

# It can be divided into multiple chapters (e.g. for endusers and developers) and formatted as simple markdown or more complex [Hugo formatting](https://bootstrap.hugoblox.com/content/writing-markdown-latex/)

# You can find more information on how to write documentation in Hugo [in their documentation](https://bootstrap.hugoblox.com/content/docs/).
