# Set up your DMP service 

DMP4NFDI supports consortia in providing a DMP service to their community. For onboarding new consortia we hold a regular call for incubator projects.  
[Learn about the next call for incubators](#next-call-for-incubators)

An incubator project is a short-term engagement (3â€“6 months) with a clearly defined goal. Typical focus areas include:

- A. **RDMO hosting**  
- B. **DMP template development**  
- C. **Training and community outreach support**  
- D. **Integration with other consortium services via plugins**
