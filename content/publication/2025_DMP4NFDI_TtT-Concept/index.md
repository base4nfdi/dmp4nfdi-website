abstract: "The DMP4NFDI Train-the-Trainer concept on Data Management Plans (DMPs) and RDMO is part of our mission to support the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) by offering consortia-oriented, reusable training formats. These trainings aim to foster the creation and use of DMPs and SMPs across the NFDI, with RDMO as the central tool. This first version is based on an extensive requirement analysis carried out during the first project phase."

summary: "Modular train-the-trainer approach for DMPs and RDMO that supports learners at different levels of expertise"
