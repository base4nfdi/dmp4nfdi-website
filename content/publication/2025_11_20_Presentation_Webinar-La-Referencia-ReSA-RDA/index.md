abstract: >
  This talk was presented on 2025-11-20 as part of the webinar series "Fortaleciendo capacidades y fomentando colaboración" organized by La Referencia, the Research Software Alliance (ReSA) and Research Data Alliance (RDA). We provided a quick overview on what Software Management Plans (SMPs) are and how they can be supported by metadata, so they become machine-actionable SMPs.
