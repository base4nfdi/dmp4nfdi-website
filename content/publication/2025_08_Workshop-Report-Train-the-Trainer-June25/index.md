  DMP4NFDI is the basic service in development for data management planning within NFDI. The service supports NFDI consortia providing services for data management plans (DMPs), software management plans (SMPs), or analogues. It offers RDMO hosting, support & training for consortia staff and develops and maintains the NFDI DMP Template Framework to facilitate template development and interoperability. The service also supports consortia to integrate DMPs, SMPs, or analogues with their service portfolio. On June 30th 2025, DMP4NFDI conducted its first Train-the-Trainer (TtT) workshop on DMPs and RDMO for the project use cases and a few other consortia who expressed a high level of interest.
