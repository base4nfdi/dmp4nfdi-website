abstract: "Achieving FAIRness of research data implies the application of best practices and machine-actionable metadata. Data management plans (DMPs) as a starting point for research data management activities can support both, when implemented as machine-actionable DMPs (maDMP). maDMP templates and tools adapted for community-specific needs communicate best practices and standardised workflows, provide up-to-date information on service offers, and connect all stakeholders involved in the RDM process. In order to achieve this interconnection, a standard for DMP templates is needed that consortia and services can rely upon. The NFDI basic service in development DMP4NFDI works towards this goal by developing a NFDI-wide standard for DMPs, the NFDI DMP Template Framework, and providing a common tool connecting consortia and their RDM services: RDMO. DMP4NFDI is based on the work of the cross-consortia working group infra-dmp in NFDI section Common Infrastructures, and the vision developed in its workshops and discussions"
