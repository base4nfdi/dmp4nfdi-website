abstract: "Data Management Plans (DMPs) and Software Management Plans (SMPs) are central to research data management, addressed by nearly all NFDI consortia. The infra-dmp working group, founded in 2022, drives these topics forward by fostering exchange on DMP tools and templates, defining shared quality criteria, and shaping a vision for DMPs in the NFDI.

One result is DMP4NFDI, a base service that supports consortia via a multi-tenant RDMO instance, a central NFDI DMP Template Framework, and associated training resources. This framework promotes interoperable, standardized DMPs and is refined in collaboration with the broader research data management community. Our poster highlights early achievements of infra-dmp’s ad-hoc groups and initial outcomes of DMP4NFDI, illustrating how these core efforts interconnect within the NFDI."

summary: "Conference/Poster entry describing the work of NFDI working group Infra-dmp and of NFDI basic service DMP4NFDI."
