abstract: >
  DMP4NFDI is the basic service in development for data management planning 
  within NFDI. The service supports NFDI consortia providing services for 
  data management plans (DMPs), software management plans (SMPs) or analogues. 
  It offers RDMO hosting, support & training for consortia staff and develops 
  and maintains the NFDI DMP Template Framework to facilitate template development 
  and interoperability, and it supports consortia to integrate DMPs, SMPs etc. 
  with their service portfolio.

  During the initial development phase (June 2024 - May 2025), we are collecting 
  requirements for DMP and SMP services in the NFDI by organising workshops and 
  exchanges with the consortia and the general RDM community. This report summarizes 
  our results after three workshops, participation in two hackathons, presenting 
  the service at several occasions and exchange with consortia in infra-dmp and 
  individual meetings.

summary: "Report on collecting DMP requirements within the NFDI."
