abstract: >
  DMP4NFDI is the basic service in development for data management planning within NFDI. The service supports NFDI consortia providing services for data management plans (DMPs), software management plans (SMPs), or analogues. It offers RDMO hosting, support & training for consortia staff and develops and maintains the NFDI DMP Template Framework to facilitate template development and interoperability. The service also supports consortia to integrate DMPs, SMPs, or analogues with their service portfolio. Within the workshop "Creating Interoperable RDMO Catalogs with the NFDI DMP Template Framework" held on March 12th, 2025 and offered in the context of the E-Science Tage conference in Heidelberg, participants were introduced to the work of the DMP4NFDI service and the first version of the framework.
