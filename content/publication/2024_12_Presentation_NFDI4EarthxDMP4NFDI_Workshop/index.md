abstract: >
  This workshop report summarizes the outcomes of the 2024 online event jointly organized by NFDI4Earth and DMP4NFDI.
  When properly used, data management plans are effective tools for supporting all phases of the research data lifecycle, from data collection to publication. The ESS community is large and diverse, so the needs in writing and managing DMPs and related templates differ. In the NFDI4Earth x DMP4NFDI Basic Service online workshop, NFDI4Earth invited DMP service providers, researchers, and interested DMP enthusiasts from the ESS community to learn more to learn more about DMP4NFDI activities, NFDI4Earth developments, and their partners' experiences in DMP service provision and consulting. This report documents the presentations and summarizes the discussions with about 30 workshop participants.
