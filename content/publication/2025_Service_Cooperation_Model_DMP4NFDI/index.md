abstract: "This DMP4NFDI Service Cooperation Model (SCM) outlines the collaboration between the basic service under development DMP4NFDI of the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) and the NFDI consortia. This first version provides clear guidance on the support provided by the basic service and the responsibilities of the consortia. It is based on the work of DMP4NFDI in the initialisation phase and will be further developed in exchange with the consortia."

summary: "Outlines the support model between DMP4NFDI and the NFDI consortia."
