  Data Management Plans are a valuable tool to support the creation of FAIR research data. The Basic Service under development, DMP4NFDI, assists NFDI consortia in providing services for Data Management Plans or Software Management Plans. The service promotes the standardisation and integration of DMPs and SMPs across the NFDI's research data ecosystem. This presentation was given as part of the NFDITalks series.
