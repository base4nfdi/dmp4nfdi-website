abstract: >
  The Basic Service DMP4NFDI supports the NFDI consortia by providing services aligned to Data Management Plans (DMPs), Software Management Plans (SMPs), and related concepts. In particular, DMP4NFDI hosts a multi-tenant instance of the open source tool RDMO that can be tailored to domain-specific needs. In addition to RDMO, DMP4NFDI services include a consulting supporting the creation of templates as well as content standardisation, complemented with training and materials  for DMP/SMP responsible staff in the NFDI consortia. The DMP4NFDI service portfolio aims to facilitate the creation of discipline-specific DMP/SMP templates using standardised, machine-actionable, and interoperable formats, as well as to support and improve communication between the different stakeholders and services involved in research data management processes, including software and data processing, from collection to validation. During the integration phase, incubator projects will facilitate a broader adoption by NFDI consortia while also supporting further development of the services. DMP4NFDI will increase its consultancy-style support to create templates and offer support for outreach measures. SMPs will complement the work done around DMPs, facilitating DMP/SMP interoperability. Furthermore, the integration phase will also look into alignment with EOSC.
