         The [Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO)](https://rdmorganiser.github.io/en/) is an open-source Data Management Plan (DMP) tool in productive use at many institutions in Germany for several years. It supports multiple DMP templates, and the RDMO community provides a growing library of templates that can be reused and adapted for discipline-specific needs. RDMO was developed on the principles of openness and adaptability. Project data can be accessed via API, and the plugin architecture enables integrations with other services. Plugins are available for integration with project management tools, querying web services and databases, and exporting to knowledge graphs. RDMO is aligned with and ready for the Research Data Alliance’s machine-actionable DMP standard, making it suitable for an NFDI-wide service.
