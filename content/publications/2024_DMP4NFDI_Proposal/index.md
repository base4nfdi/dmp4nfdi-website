abstract: >
  This proposal outlines DMP4NFDI, a centralized Basic Service for NFDI-wide data management plans (DMPs) and software management plans (SMPs), addressing critical gaps in the NFDI infrastructure for their use and application. In addition to centrally hosting the open-source DMP tool RDMO, the service will coordinate template creation, content standardization, and provide guidance through training and support to consortial staff responsible for DMPs. These measures aim to facilitate discipline-specific DMP templates in standardized, machine-readable, and interoperable formats, enhancing communication among stakeholders and services involved in an RDM process, supporting processes like data collection and review.
  The initialization phase includes engaging consortia as early adopters to refine requirements, support the development of DMP templates, creating a DMP template framework for the NFDI and prototypes for service integrations in RDMO. The service aims to maximize the benefits of a widespread adoption and utilization of DMPs for the entire research data ecosystem of the NFDI by fostering interoperability and integration of DMPs with RDMO across the NFDI through its central coordination.
