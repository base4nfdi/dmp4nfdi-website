We presented our poster: [**“From Templates to Interoperability with the NFDI DMP Template Framework”**](/publication/2026_02_poster_rda-de_dmp4nfdi/) at the **RDA Germany Conference 2026**. 

Attendees had the opportunity to learn how the framework supports standardised, interoperable DMP templates across NFDI consortia. Key insights were presented during [Session 5 – Minute Madness Poster Spotlight](https://indico.desy.de/event/50156/sessions/21018/#20260224) on **24 February 2026 at 16:30**.

The RDA Deutschland Tagung 2026 is organised by RDA Deutschland e.V. with the Helmholtz Open Science Office. It took place from **February 24 to 25, 2026, at the GFZ Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences** (Haus H).
